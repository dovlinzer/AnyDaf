# Ketubot 93 — Daf Yomi Shiur

## Three Wives Case

### Mishna Setup

The daf opens with a *mishna* presenting one of the most analytically challenging division problems in all of rabbinic literature. The case: a man married three women and died. Rashi specifies that all three were married on the same day, a necessary condition for the problem to arise at all — if they had married on different days, the earlier *kesuvah* would hold a prior lien, and the division would simply proceed in chronological order of priority regardless of claim size. The three women hold *ketubot* of 100, 200, and 300 respectively. The question is how the estate is to be divided among them when its total value may be less than the sum of their claims.

### Estate = 100

When the estate is worth only 100, the *mishna* rules that the three women divide it equally — each receiving 33⅓. This is intuitive: all three women have an equal and total claim on that first 100. The woman owed 100 says "give me the 100," the woman owed 200 says "give me the 100," and the woman owed 300 says the same. Their claims are indistinguishable in their force against that amount, so equal division follows naturally.

### Estate = 200

The second case is where the difficulty begins. When the estate is worth 200, the *mishna* prescribes a distribution of 50 to the woman with the 100 *kesuvah*, and 75 each to the women with the 200 and 300 *ketubot*. This is deeply puzzling. One might attempt to apply the logic of the first case: on the first 100, all three have equal claims and divide it equally, yielding 33⅓ each. On the second 100, only the women with claims of 200 and 300 remain, and since both assert equal and total claims on that amount, they divide it equally — 50 each. That would yield 33⅓, 83⅓, and 83⅓. But the *mishna* gives 50, 75, 75. The problem is not merely that the numbers differ — it is that the *mishna*'s division does not transparently follow any single coherent principle. Why 50 as the threshold for the first division rather than 40 or 60? The *gemara* itself will note this difficulty explicitly, and Tosafot acknowledges that the rationale has not been satisfactorily explained.

### Estate = 300

The third case, where the estate equals 300, yields a distribution of 50, 100, and 150. Unlike the second case, this result follows cleanly from a straightforward model: proportional division according to claim size. The claims of 100, 200, and 300 stand in a ratio of 1:2:3, totaling 6 parts. One-sixth of 300 is 50, two-sixths is 100, and three-sixths is 150. This model works elegantly here. The difficulty is that it does not explain either of the earlier cases — applied to the estate of 200, proportional division would yield 33⅓, 66⅔, and 100, not 50, 75, 75.

### Two Models Explained

The *mishna* thus appears to employ at least two distinct models across its three cases, and possibly three. The first case follows a principle of equal division among all claimants with equal standing. The third case follows proportional division by claim size. The second case follows neither, at least not in any obvious way. The final line of the *mishna* — *v'chein gimel she'hitilu lakis*, "and so too with three who invested into a common purse" — reinforces the proportional model for the third case: if three partners invest 100, 200, and 300 respectively, the profits and losses are divided proportionally to their contributions. This makes good sense as a model for investment. It does not, however, explain the middle case, and the *mishna* presents all three rules as if they constitute a unified system.

## Aumann's Solution

### Aumann Introduction

It was the economist and mathematician Robert Aumann — Nobel laureate and game theorist — who, roughly 1,800 years after the *mishna* was written, published a paper demonstrating that all three cases follow a single, coherent, and mathematically unique principle. The paper appeared in the collected papers of Robert Aumann and was also printed in the Hebrew Torah journal *Moriah*. Once the principle is understood, the response is immediate: this must be the *pshat* of the *mishna*.

### Shnayim Ochzim Model

The foundation of Aumann's insight was already anticipated — at least partially — by the *Geonim* and by Rashi, who noted that the operative principle should be the one derived from the first *mishna* of Bava Metzia. In that famous case of *shnayim ochzim b'tallit* — two people grasping a garment — each claiming it entirely, the garment is divided equally. More precisely, what the *mishna* establishes is that what one side has already conceded to the other should be set aside, and only the contested portion is divided equally. If I claim half the garment and you claim all of it, I have implicitly conceded half to you. You receive that half outright; only the remaining half is in genuine dispute, and that is divided equally between us — yielding you three-quarters and me one-quarter. The principle, then, is: concede what is conceded, and divide equally only what is genuinely disputed.

### Pairwise Analysis

Aumann's critical insight — the step that eluded the *rishonim* — was that this principle must be applied not to all three women simultaneously as a group, but to every possible *pair* of claimants. In a three-claimant case, there are three such pairs: the 100 and 200 women, the 200 and 300 women, and the 100 and 300 women. Whatever amounts are assigned to any two of the claimants must satisfy the *shnayim ochzim* rule when those two are examined in isolation.

### Backwards Calculation

Working backwards from the *mishna*'s answer of 50, 75, 75 in the case of an estate worth 200, Aumann demonstrates that the numbers are consistent. The woman with the 100 *kesuvah* receives 50, and the woman with the 200 *kesuvah* receives 75 — a combined total of 125. Consider those two women alone: if 125 were being divided between a claimant of 100 and a claimant of 200, the first 100 is disputed equally between them (neither concedes anything within that range), yielding 50 each; the remaining 25 is conceded entirely by the 100-woman (whose claim is exhausted), so it goes entirely to the 200-woman. The result is exactly 50 and 75. The same analysis applies to every other pair.

### Pairwise Verification

The verification proceeds across all three pairs. The women with 200 and 300 *ketubot* receive 75 and 75, a combined total of 150. If 150 is divided between a claimant of 200 and a claimant of 300, neither concedes anything — both have claims exceeding 150 — so the entire amount is in dispute and is divided equally: 75 and 75. This matches. Now consider the women with 100 and 300 *ketubot*, who receive 50 and 75, totaling 125. Of that 125, the first 100 is in genuine dispute between them; they divide it equally (50 each). The remaining 25 is conceded by the 100-woman and goes entirely to the 300-woman, yielding 50 and 75. Again, this matches precisely. The solution works for every pairwise combination without exception.

For the case of the estate worth 300, the same verification holds. The 100 and 200 women receive 50 and 100, totaling 150. Dividing 150 between claims of 100 and 200: the first 100 is disputed equally (50 each), the remaining 50 is conceded by the 100-woman and goes to the 200-woman — giving 50 and 100. The 200 and 300 women receive 100 and 150, totaling 250. Dividing 250 between claims of 200 and 300: the first 200 is disputed equally (100 each), the remaining 50 is conceded by the 200-woman and goes to the 300-woman — giving 100 and 150. All pairs check out.

### Uniqueness Proof

What makes the result publishable — and what transforms it from an observation into a theorem — is Aumann's proof that for any number of claimants and any estate size, there is always exactly one and uniquely one division that satisfies the pairwise *shnayim ochzim* rule for every possible pair simultaneously. It is something like a Sudoku: there are constraints, and those constraints determine a unique solution. The *mishna*'s three cases, which appeared to follow unrelated rules, in fact all reflect this single underlying principle. One might add: it is striking that this explanation was apparently lost, that the *rishonim* could not reconstruct it, and that Tosafot itself acknowledges — in its laconic way — *lo ispareish shapir ta'ama d'hanei milta*: the rationale for these matters has not been well explained.

## Gemara Solutions

### Gemara Problem

The *gemara* focuses its critical attention on the second case, the one that resists obvious explanation. The *mishna* states that when the estate is worth 200, the woman with the 100 *kesuvah* receives 50. The *gemara* asks: why 50? She should receive only 33⅓. If we apply the principle of dividing equally what is disputed and conceding what is conceded, but we apply it to all three women together as a group, the reasoning would proceed as follows: on the first 100, all three have equal and total claims, so it is divided equally among them — 33⅓ each. On the second 100, the 100-woman has already staked her full claim; only the 200-woman and the 300-woman remain as claimants, and they divide it equally — 50 each. The result would be 33⅓, 83⅓, 83⅓ — not 50, 75, 75. The *gemara* thus implicitly accepts the principle of conceding what is conceded and dividing the remainder equally, but applies it group-wise rather than pairwise, and finds that the *mishna*'s answer does not follow.

### Shmuel's First Case

Shmuel offers an *okimta* — a contextualizing reinterpretation — to explain the second case. He says the *mishna* is dealing with a special situation: Mrs. 200 has written to Mrs. 100 a declaration that she waives any dispute with her (*din u'devarim ein li imach*) over the first 100. In other words, Mrs. 200 has removed herself from the contest with Mrs. 100 over that portion. With Mrs. 200 standing aside, Mrs. 100 is left dividing the first 100 with Mrs. 300 only. Those two divide it equally, and Mrs. 100 walks away with 50.

### Waiver Logic

The *gemara* immediately challenges this: if Mrs. 200 waived her claim against Mrs. 100 in the first 100, then when we get to the second 100, shouldn't Mrs. 300 be able to say to Mrs. 200 — you have already removed yourself from this *kesuvah*, so you have no standing here either? And if the two of them do compete on the second 100, why do they each get 75, not 66⅔ for Mrs. 300 and 83⅓ for Mrs. 200?

The *gemara* answers in Mrs. 200's voice: *mi'din u'devarim hu de'siliki nafshi* — "I only withdrew from the legal dispute; I did not give her a gift." The distinction is subtle. Mrs. 200's portion in the first 100 was 33⅓, representing her contested claim as one of three competing creditors. She conceded her claim *against* Mrs. 100 specifically, meaning she would not be counted as a competing force against Mrs. 100. The effect is that Mrs. 100 now faces only one competitor — Mrs. 300 — over that first 100, and they divide it equally, yielding 50 to Mrs. 100. Mrs. 200 has not transferred her claim to Mrs. 100 as a gift; she has simply stepped back from the contest. Now 50 remains. Mrs. 200 and Mrs. 300 stand in equal dispute over that remaining 50, dividing it 25 and 25 — giving 75 to each. This is the logic, though Tosafot itself notes, as mentioned earlier, that the rationale has not been fully and cleanly articulated within this framework.

### Shmuel's Second Case

For the third case — the estate of 300 — Shmuel offers a second, entirely separate *okimta*. Here, it is Mrs. 300 who has written to both Mrs. 100 and Mrs. 200 a declaration that she removes herself from dispute over the first 100 entirely. With Mrs. 300 absent from the first 100, Mrs. 100 and Mrs. 200 divide it equally — each receiving 50. Now for the second 100, Mrs. 300 has only waived her claim over the first 100; she re-enters for the second. All three divide the second 100 equally — another 33⅓ each, but since Mrs. 100 is already at her cap of 100, her claim is exhausted; in the contest over the second 100 between Mrs. 200 and Mrs. 300, they divide it equally — 50 to each. The final 100 is uncontested, going entirely to Mrs. 300. The result: 50, 100, 150. Shmuel's explanation works arithmetically, but is candidly arbitrary — it posits an ad hoc legal fiction for each case with no unifying principle connecting them.

### Staged Seizure Model

Rabbi Yaakov from Nehar Pekod, in the name of Ravina, proposes a different framework for both cases — one that does not rely on declarations of waiver but on the physical reality of when property is seized. He argues: *reisha bishtei tefisot ve-seifa bishtei tefisot* — both the second and third cases of the *mishna* involve two separate acts of seizure, two distinct moments at which property is grabbed, each of which must be adjudicated independently. The *mishna* is not describing a beit din sitting down with a full estate and dividing it in one stroke; it is describing a scenario in which property becomes available in stages, and each batch of property seized triggers its own independent division.

### Two Stages Analysis

In the case of the estate of 200, Rabbi Yaakov says the property was seized in two batches: first, 75 was seized simultaneously by all three women, and then 125 was seized simultaneously. When 75 is seized and all three women have equal and total claims on it, it is divided equally: 25 each. When 125 is then seized, we apply the *shnayim ochzim* analysis to this batch. The 100-woman still has 75 of her claim outstanding, so within the first 75 of this 125, all three compete equally — 25 each. The remaining 50 of this 125 exceeds the 100-woman's remaining claim; she has no stake there, leaving the 200-woman and 300-woman to divide it equally — 25 each. The result per person across both seizures: Mrs. 100 gets 25 + 25 = 50; Mrs. 200 gets 25 + 25 + 25 = 75; Mrs. 300 gets 25 + 25 + 25 = 75. This matches the *mishna*.

For the third case, the estate of 300, the property is again seized in two batches: first 75, then 225. The first 75 is divided equally — 25 each. Within the 225: the first 75 is in equal dispute among all three (25 each); of the next 150, Mrs. 100's claim is now exhausted (she has received 50), leaving Mrs. 200 and Mrs. 300. Rashi's treatment here is acknowledged to be descriptive rather than explanatory — he notes the outcome but does not fully derive why the 100 should come to be divided equally and the 50 given entirely to one party, and the underlying arithmetic of this final stage is difficult to reconstruct cleanly from first principles. Nonetheless, the conceptual thrust of the staged model is clear: the staged seizures force us to deal with the estate in segments, and each segment is governed by the *shnayim ochzim* principle applied to whoever retains an active claim at that moment.

The staged seizure model shares a structural intuition with Aumann's approach — both involve breaking the total amount into sub-units and identifying who has standing at each level — but Rabbi Yaakov's version is an *okimta* grounded in a specific physical scenario rather than a general mathematical theorem. The *mishna* according to this reading is not stating a universal rule but describing what happens when the circumstances on the ground happen to produce these particular seizure stages.

## Rabbi's Position

### Rabbi Rejects Natan

A *baraita* now informs us: *tanya zu mishnat Rabbi Natan* — this *mishna* is the teaching of Rabbi Natan. On this, Rabbi — the redactor of the *Mishnah* itself — says: *eini ro'eh divrei Rabbi Natan b'elu* — I do not see the logic of Rabbi Natan's words here, or perhaps: I do not accept them. In place of Rabbi Natan's complex graduated division, Rabbi says: *ela cholkim b'shaveh*.

### Mishna Authority Q

This raises a striking question: if Rabbi himself did not accept Rabbi Natan's ruling, why did he codify it as the *stam* — the anonymous, authoritative — *mishna*? It is a known phenomenon that Rabbi, as *mesader ha-mishna*, would sometimes record a minority or disputed opinion as the *stam mishna*, thereby lending it greater authority. But the question cuts the other way here: if the opinion is not his own, why give it that status? The text *tanya zu mishnat Rabbi Natan* might also suggest that this was a recognized independent collection — *mishnat Rabbi Natan* — perhaps connected to the tradition that Rabbi Natan's collection was characterized as *kav v'naki*, compact and precise. Whether Rabbi found the system conceptually valid but difficult to articulate, or simply chose to preserve an established tradition while registering his personal difficulty with it, remains genuinely unclear.

### Tosafot on Proportional

Tosafot addresses the question of what Rabbi's alternative — *cholkim b'shaveh* — actually means. Rabbeinu Chananel rules that the *halacha* follows Rabbi, so the entire elaboration of the Aumann solution, however brilliant, is *Torah lishmah* for practical purposes. As for the content of Rabbi's position: one reading of *cholkim b'shaveh* would be purely equal division — each woman receives an equal share regardless of her claim, up to the point her claim is satisfied. Tosafot rejects the implication that the larger claimant would receive no more than the smaller one, noting that *she'midat ha-din lo ken* — this does not conform to the measure of justice. Instead, Tosafot understands *cholkim b'shaveh* to mean proportional division in accordance with the size of each woman's claim — that is, the investment model applied universally. Each unit of *maneh* in the *kesuvah* entitles its holder to an equal share of that unit of the estate. Applied to the estate of 200: one-sixth of 200 is 33⅓, two-sixths is 66⅔, three-sixths is 100. Applied to the estate of 300: 50, 100, 150. This, according to Tosafot, is what Rabbi means, and it is the rule by which we rule.

## Investment Partnership

### Shmuel Investment

The *mishna* concludes with the parallel case of three partners who pool their money — *hitilu la-kis* — contributing 100, 200, and 300 respectively. Shmuel draws attention to a related rule: *shnayim she'hitilu la-kis zeh maneh v'zeh matayim ha-sachar l'emtza* — two partners who invest 100 and 200 respectively divide their earnings equally. Shmuel's language — *ha-sachar l'emtza*, "the earnings to the middle" — is deliberately chosen. The equal division applies to profits.

### Rava's Indivisible Asset

Rava qualifies Shmuel's ruling significantly: *mistavra milta de-Shmuel b'shor l'charisha v'omed l'charisha* — Shmuel's principle makes sense when we are dealing with an ox bought for plowing and used for plowing. The logic is that an ox engaged in agricultural labor is a single, indivisible asset. When it plows, it earns rental income as a whole unit. It is not the case that two-thirds of the plowing was done by Michael's two-thirds of the ox and one-third by my one-third — the ox plows as an ox. Therefore, while Michael has more capital at risk, the asset generating the return is indivisible, and the return it generates is treated as attributable equally to each partner's stake in that indivisible unit. This at least provides some conceptual grounding for Shmuel's otherwise counterintuitive rule, even if it remains economically strange.

However, Rava continues: *aval b'shor l'charisha v'omed l'tveicha* — but if the ox was bought for plowing and then the partners decided to slaughter it for meat, that is a different matter. Here, as Rashi explains, *omed* means not the original intention of the seller but the partners' own subsequent choice — they bought it for plowing but ultimately determined that slaughtering it was more profitable. Once slaughtered, the ox has been converted into a divisible asset: meat that can be parceled out, weighed, and sold in proportion. In that case, the division must follow each partner's proportional investment: *zeh notel l'fi ma'otav v'zeh notel l'fi ma'otav*.

### Hamnuna's Position

Rav Hamnuna disagrees: *afilu shor l'charisha v'omed l'tveicha ha-sachar l'emtza* — even if the ox was bought for plowing and later slaughtered, the proceeds are still divided equally. His reasoning is that the nature of the partnership was established at the outset — they entered as partners in an ox bought for plowing, and that original characterization defines the partnership terms regardless of what subsequently happens to the asset. The intent with which the joint acquisition was made governs the division of whatever it yields.

### Plowing vs. Slaughter

The *gemara* resolves the dispute between Rava and Rav Hamnuna by invoking a *tosefta*. The *tosefta* states that two partners who invest 100 and 200 divide the earnings equally — which initially seems to support Rav Hamnuna's broader position. The *gemara* asks: is this not dealing with a case of an ox bought for plowing that was then slaughtered, thereby supporting Rav Hamnuna against Rava? The *gemara* pushes back: no, the *tosefta* is referring only to the case of *shor l'charisha v'omed l'charisha* — bought for plowing and used for plowing. The question then becomes: if the *tosefta* intended to address the case of an ox bought for plowing and then slaughtered, it should have said so explicitly and stated that even in that case the division is equal. The *gemara* resolves this: the *tosefta* is in fact implicitly consistent with Rava. Its equal-division ruling applies only to the standard plowing case; for the slaughter case, the *tosefta* itself provides that *zeh notel l'fi ma'otav v'zeh notel l'fi ma'otav* — each takes proportionally. The final ruling is that when an ox is bought for plowing and remains in that use, the earnings are equal; if it was bought for plowing but was then slaughtered, the division is proportional.

### Tosafta Discrete Goods

The *tosefta* also addresses a further scenario: *lakach zeh b'shelo v'zeh b'shelo v'nitarevu* — each partner separately bought his own oxen with his share of the investment, and then the animals became mixed together so that it is no longer possible to identify which ox belongs to whom. In that case, even though the ownership is uncertain in fact, the proportional stakes are known — one partner owns a third, the other two-thirds — and the division follows accordingly: *zeh notel l'fi mamo v'zeh notel l'fi mamo*. Tosafot draws from this the broader principle that any investment structured around discrete, divisible goods is divided proportionally from the outset. The argument about equal division applies only where the partners genuinely entered a partnership in a single indivisible asset. Where the assets are inherently discrete and the investment is proportional in kind — whether it is livestock, goods, or money — all authorities agree that division follows the proportion of the investment.

## Investment & Wives Link

### Investment Profit Rule

The *mishna*'s final ruling on the investment case — *pichatu o hotiru kach hen cholkin*, if the investment lost or gained value they divide accordingly — is brought to bear on the *gemara*'s analysis. One might assume this refers simply to the normal case of a divisible investment that went up or down in value, with profits and losses divided proportionally in the obvious way. If so, it would be an unremarkable restatement. But the *gemara* raises the possibility that the *mishna* might be referring to something more unusual.

### Intrinsic Value Change

Rav Nachman in the name of Rabbah bar Avuha explains: *lo*, this is not about normal market gains or losses. *Hotiru* — "they increased" — means *zuza chadtiti*, the coins themselves became newer and thus worth more intrinsically. *Pichatu* — "they decreased" — means *astira de-tzunita*, the coins deteriorated to the point of being used as metal tokens to place under the heel for some medicinal purpose, indicating they lost their monetary value entirely. In other words, the *mishna* is describing a change in the *intrinsic value of the currency itself*, not merely a return on an investment.

### Principal Value Impact

The implication is significant. If the partners had invested in an ox that earned rental income, and the question is how to divide that rental income, that is the case Shmuel addresses — and the division could be equal or proportional depending on the nature of the asset. But if what changed is the principal itself — the currency in which the investment was denominated went up or down in intrinsic value — then what is being divided is not profit from a jointly-owned indivisible asset, but a change in the value of what each partner actually contributed. In that case, since each partner owns his proportional share of the principal, any change in the value of that principal accrues or diminishes proportionally. The partner who invested 200 owns twice as much of the monetary principal as the partner who invested 100, and when the money itself changes in value, the gain or loss is distributed accordingly. This applies equally to the *mishna*'s wives case: when the underlying value of the estate fluctuates at the level of principal, each woman's proportional stake governs the division of gains and losses.
